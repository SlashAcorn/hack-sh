# hack.sh
This is a repo for my epic hacking script I made when I was bored
(THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO ANY HACKING WHATSOEVER)

## The with-install variant of this script only works on arch and arch-based linux distrobutions but I might expand it.

## Dependencies
 * mpv
 * youtube-dl
 * ffmpeg

## What the script Does
 It asks you to type ``Yes! Do as I say.`` as a reference to the linus tech tips linux challenge
 While it is "Hacking" it is actually downloading Never Gonna give you up to /tmp
 It will say that hacking is complete and use mpv to play it.
